"""
Explanation of the Code:

1.Initialization:
a.left points to the beginning of the array.
b.right points to the end of the array.

2.Binary Search Loop:
a.Calculate the middle index, mid.
b.Compare arr[mid] with arr[right]:
--If arr[mid] > arr[right], move left to mid + 1 (pivot is in the right half).
--Otherwise, move right to mid (pivot is in the left half).

3.Final Result:
The left index points to the smallest element, which gives the rotation count ùëò.

4.Time Complexity
Binary Search:(logùëõ)
Space Complexity:O(1)
